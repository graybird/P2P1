<h1>NeuroGrid Simulator Applet Instructions</h1>
<p>The NeuroGrid Simulator applet can simulate a variety of routing  
methodologies in small peer to peer networks.&nbsp; The code can be found at <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/neurogrid/">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/neurogrid/</a>  
and includes classes that operate without the applet GUI that allow simulations  
to be performed with much larger numbers of nodes, and appropriate statistics to  
be calculated.</p> 
<p>However the applet itself is a useful debugging tool to see what is going on  
in the network at a small scale.&nbsp; Various parameters can be adjusted using  
the applet GUI, and hitting the restart button will stop the current network  
simulation and re-initialize the network using the new parameters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The basic operation of the simulation is to create a collection of documents  
that are then assigned keywords either randomly or according to the <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.com/do_you_know/zipfLaw.html">Zipf  
distribution</a>.&nbsp; Then the network is created according to the relevant  
parameters and documents distributed over the nodes.&nbsp; Searches are then  
performed in serial, a document from the collection being selected at random and  
a search being conducted for that document by looking for nodes that contain  
documents with the keywords belonging to that document.&nbsp; The GUI doesn't  
display much information about where which documents are located at the moment,  
but that is partly because I haven't had time to add that, and partly because it  
is not clear how best to display that information without hopelessly cluttering  
up the display.</p> 
<p>The green lines are connections between nodes.&nbsp; The squares are nodes,  
and the orange blobs are messages.&nbsp; The nodes turn from white to gray when  
they receive a message allowing us to follow what proportion of the network has  
been reached in the current search.</p> 
<p>You can see some of the results of simulations using this code at <a href="http://www.neurogrid.net/si-simulation02.html">http://www.neurogrid.net/si-simulation02.html</a></p>
<p>The parameters affect the simulation as follows:</p> 
<table border="1" width="100%" height="493"> 
  <tr> 
    <td width="50%" height="48">Zipf Checkbox</td> 
    <td width="50%" height="48">When ticked the keywords are assigned to  
      documents according to a Zipf Distribution, when not ticked the  
      distribution if Uniform.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td width="50%" height="48">Knowledge Checkbox</td> 
    <td width="50%" height="48">When ticked, nodes exchange lists of keywords  
      that they have documents associated with, with their immediate neighbours.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td width="50%" height="64">Learning Checkbox</td> 
    <td width="50%" height="64">When ticked the results of searches lead to the  
      updating of knowledge base of the node initiating the search, i.e. it  
      learns to associate the node that contained the relevant document with the  
      keywords used in the search.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td width="50%" height="48">Ring Checkbox</td> 
    <td width="50%" height="48">When ticked the nodes are connected in a regular  
      fashion creating a ring.&nbsp; When not ticked, the connections are  
      created randomly.</td>

  </tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td width="50%" height="16">Thread Sleep</td> 
    <td width="50%" height="16">The number of milliseconds pause in-between each  
      message forward.&nbsp; Going below 100 milliseconds in a browser normally  
      crashes the system.&nbsp; If you want more speed, download the code and  
      run in an appletviewer.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td width="50%" height="16">Forwarding</td> 
    <td width="50%" height="16">The number of connected nodes to forward a  
      message to.&nbsp; When set to zero each forwarding of a message will be to  
      all connected nodes - Gnutella-like behaviour.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td width="50%" height="16">Run Length</td> 
    <td width="50%" height="16">The number of searches performed before the

  </tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td width="50%" height="16">No Documents</td> 
    <td width="50%" height="16">The number of documents in the simulation.</td>

    <td width="50%" height="16">The Time To Live (TTL) of each message, i.e. the  
      number of times it can be forwarded before it expires.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td width="50%" height="16">Degree of Correlation</td> 
    <td width="50%" height="16">Can be used to force initial neighbours to have  
      related collections of documents.&nbsp; The higher the value the more  
      keywords that any two connected nodes will have in common at the start of  
      the simulation - should really be replaced with an appropriate node  
      addition scheme where nodes connect to other nodes with similar content.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td width="50%" height="16">Conns per Node</td> 
    <td width="50%" height="16">The number of starting connections for each

      the detail of the debug messages.</td>
